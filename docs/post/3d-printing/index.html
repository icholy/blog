  <h1>3D Printing</h1>
  <time datetime=2023-12-09T09:11:00-0500 class="post-date">Sat, Dec 9, 2023</time>
  <p>About a year ago, I purchased a BambuLab P1P 3D printer for about $1000 CAD (after taxes and shipping). This is something I’ve wanted to do on-and-off for the past 10 years and I finally decided to pull the trigger.</p>
<p>For my first few projects, I decided to print existing STL models I found on the internet instead of designing my own. This was a good idea at first, but eventually led me down the (very expensive) rabbit hole of 3D printed RC (Radio Control) vehicles. This was not ideal because it resulted in learning (and paying for) two separate hobbies at the same time: 3D printing + RC. The cost and complexity of the project was off-putting and the printer sat idle for a few months after that.</p>
<p>The hiatus finally ended when a friend asked me if I could 3D print table numbers for her wedding. Although seemingly trivial, the project was a perfect match for my 3D modeling skill level (or lack thereof). Next I made a model rocket with an accompanying launch pad. My most recent project is a Christmas tree topper which I’m especially proud of.</p>
<p>There’s something truly satisfying about printing something you designed and modeled. It’s akin to the feeling I used to get when I began to learn programming. The joy of watching your creation take life is unparalleled. I can’t say for sure when or why, but I stopped getting that from software at some point. When I was younger, a mechanic asked me if I liked cars and I responded “yes”. He then said that “if you become a mechanic, you won’t like cars anymore”. Perhaps he was onto something.</p>
