      <description>I discovered a cool little feature in less (not less.css) today. You can interactively filter the data.
&amp;amp;pattern Display only lines which match the pattern; lines which do not match the pattern are not displayed. If pattern is empty (if you type &amp;amp; immediately followed by ENTER), any filtering is turned off, and all lines are displayed. While filtering is in effect, an ampersand is displayed at the beginning of the prompt, as a reminder that some lines in the file may be hidden.</description>
