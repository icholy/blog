      <description>About a year ago, I purchased a BambuLab P1P 3D printer for about $1000 CAD (after taxes and shipping). This is something Iâ€™ve wanted to do on-and-off for the past 10 years and I finally decided to pull the trigger.&#xA;For my first few projects, I decided to print existing STL models I found on the internet instead of designing my own. This was a good idea at first, but eventually led me down the (very expensive) rabbit hole of 3D printed RC (Radio Control) vehicles.</description>
