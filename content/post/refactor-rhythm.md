Refactoring typically cycles between two distinct modes:

- **Small, local changes** that enable larger structural improvements.
- **Large, cross-cutting changes** that improve the overall design.

Before the big changes can happen, many small adjustments are needed to make them feasible. What developers often won’t admit is that they usually _don’t know_ what those large changes will be at the outset. Instead, the initial small edits serve a dual purpose: they not only prepare the codebase but also help the developer re-familiarize themselves with the system.

Refactoring, in this sense, is a kind of guided search through the structure of the code. Each change in the early phase acts as a probe that helps the developer uncover constraints, recognize patterns, and identify weak points in the design.

If we were to chart the value of changes over a refactoring cycle, the pattern would look something like this:

- **Early stage**: a burst of small, low-risk changes as the developer orients themselves.
- **Middle stage**: larger, higher-value changes begin to emerge, interleaved with smaller supporting edits.
- **Late stage**: a return to smaller changes, as the obvious large improvements have been exhausted.

I need to get better at recognising when I've entered that final phase. Continuing to make low-impact changes at that point often leads to diminishing returns and wasted effort.
