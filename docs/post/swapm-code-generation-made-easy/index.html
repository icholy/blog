  <h1>SWAPM: Code generation made easy.</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-10-18T12:02:06-0400 class="post-date">Thu, Oct 18, 2012</time>
  <p>I finally got around to reading the Pragmatic Programmer book. One thing that really interested me was the section on Code Generation. So in a recent C++ project I was interfacing with postgres and there was a LOT of code repetition. The sql query, class members, getters/setters, response parsing logic. They all contained the same information. Perfect I thought, here was the ideal chance to give code generation a shot. My first incarnation was a very ugly perl script (aren&rsquo;t they all .. ?)  which used mustache as the templating engine. It worked, But I had to copy and paste the generated code into my source every time it changed which was a pain.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I really wanted:</p>
<ul>
<li>have the generated code automatically be inserted into my source.</li>
<li>have an extemely simple templating language</li>
<li>solution for situations where simple templating wasn&rsquo;t enough (computed properties).</li>
<li>separate my data from the templates</li>
<li>VERY easy to use.</li>
<li>VERY easy to integrate into existing projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent a decent amount of time googling but all I found was</p>
<ul>
<li>cheetah: <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/</a></li>
<li>cog: <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/">http://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like them though. Cheetah is too complicated and cog is too limited.</p>
<p>So I set off to make my own. <a href="https://github.com/icholy/swapm">https://github.com/icholy/swapm</a> . I am using it in my projects with a very high level of satisfaction. I wrote it in javascript because node makes it portable, npm makes distribution painless, and I wanted support for having computed properties in my data.</p>
<p>Regarding the name, I&rsquo;m not very creative and originally called it swap but that name was already taken on npm. So I renamed it to swapm pronounced &ldquo;Swap-Em&rdquo;.</p>
<p>** Note: ** It&rsquo;s still very much a work in progress at the time of writing so use at your own risk of it eating your code. Github issues are always appreciated.</p>
