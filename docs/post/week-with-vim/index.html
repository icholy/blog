  <h1>A week with Vim</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-10-16T12:17:21-0400 class="post-date">Tue, Oct 16, 2012</time>
  <p>During the past week I&rsquo;ve been learning to use Vim (gVim). Day 1 and 2 weren&rsquo;t fun to say the least. But now I&rsquo;m completely hooked. I&rsquo;m the type of person who will sit there for hours customizing my development environment until I think it&rsquo;s perfect. I&rsquo;ve been playing with almost every cool plugin i can find (and wasting a lot of time in the process).</p>
<p><img src="/images/vim-cheatsheet.png" alt="vim cheatsheet"></p>
<p>So Vim is, without a doubt, the best text editor I&rsquo;ve ever used. However, that&rsquo;s all it is. It&rsquo;s just a text editor and I know a lot people don&rsquo;t agree with me on this one, but IDE&rsquo;s do help. They just make everything better. Therefore the ultimate combination would be an ide with vim as the text editor.</p>
<p><strong>Netbeans jVi</strong> is the first thing I tried and it was far too limiting when you&rsquo;re already used to Vim. I think this plugin would be good to someone who wished to add some Vim-like functionality to netbeans as opposed to making the netbeans text editor perfectly emulate vim7.</p>
<p><strong>Vim (NerdTree, Sessions, OmniComplete w/ctags, etc..)</strong> is what I tried next. I wanted to see if I could turn vim into a sort of IDE like setup with plugins. Although I can&rsquo;t give any specific reasons why, I didn&rsquo;t like it&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>EClim (Vim + Eclipse):</strong> I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of eclipse because it&rsquo;s just too slow. But after finding out about eclim I had to try it out. Basically you can either embed vim into eclipse, or have eclipse running as a daemon and vim connects to it. The results were very nice aside from one thing: it was slow which kind of defeats the purpose of vim.</p>
<p>So atm i&rsquo;m still looking for the idea setup. One thing that I&rsquo;ve really wanted to try was</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2010</li>
<li>Visual Assist X</li>
<li>ViEmu</li>
</ul>
<p>Although ViEmu is just another emulator, the idea of using vim with visual assist x sounds incredible. However, this setup would have a serious implication &hellip;. switching to windows. I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable developing on a virtual machine so a dual boot might be in order.</p>
