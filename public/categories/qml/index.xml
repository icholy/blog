      <description>QML is Nokia&amp;rsquo;s recent addition to its well known Qt framework and comes part of the Qt Quick Suite
The way I describe it to people is:
 it&amp;rsquo;s like html and css combined with the power of Qt in a extremely simple syntax.
 Why? I have used Swing, WinForms, and GTK in the past and never really liked anything to do with GUI work. QML is the first time I&amp;rsquo;m actually enjoying designing user interfaces and this results in a better end result.</description>
