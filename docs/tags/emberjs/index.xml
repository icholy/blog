      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered the brilliant Ember.js library and the first major issue I ran into was how to organize/modularize this thing!? At first I just opted into RequireJs because that&amp;rsquo;s what I know but I started hitting walls fast. I decided to try out the Brunch build system since I had heard good things about it before and this was a great opportunity to learn how to use it. Brunch uses skeletons which are essentially project templates to get rid of the boilerplate.</description>
