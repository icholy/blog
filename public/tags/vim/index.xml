      <description>During the past week I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning to use Vim (gVim). Day 1 and 2 weren&amp;rsquo;t fun to say the least. But now I&amp;rsquo;m completely hooked. I&amp;rsquo;m the type of person who will sit there for hours customizing my development environment until I think it&amp;rsquo;s perfect. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with almost every cool plugin i can find (and wasting a lot of time in the process).
So Vim is, without a doubt, the best text editor I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.</description>
