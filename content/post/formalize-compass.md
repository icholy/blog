I think forms and all things related ( inputs, buttons, etc... ) are probably one of the more annoying things when building a website. They're just not consistent and it takes a lot of effort to make them look decent. I spent some time looking for a tool to help me with this and I ended up with formalize which comes as a compass plugin and integrates with any web framework you're using. http://formalize.me/ It actually didn't jump out at me the first time around when I checked out the site. It didn't 'dazzel' me so I kept looking, but what I realized was that it shouldn't stand out. It's a form... You don't want it to be shiny with crazy animations. So I went back and used it for the project I'm currently working on. It was perfect... enough said.
